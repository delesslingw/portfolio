Suspended from the ceiling, a life-sized canvas frame enclosed the performer seated on a pedestal, their body both present and withheld. Above the head, in bold lettering, hovered a phone number: 803-323-7638. Across the gallery, library index cards dangled from strings, each a directive — “text me you love me,” “text me you hate me,” “tell me about her,” “tell me about it.”

The space swelled with noise: visitors shouted, laughed, jeered, and demanded acknowledgement. Yet the performer sat impassive, never responding to the din. Only through text was exchange possible. Every digital message — prank, threat, confession, erotic overture, unguarded admission — was answered.

The work staged a collision between presence and mediation, interrogating how ubiquitous technologies fracture immediacy, reconfiguring intimacy and estrangement, and how communication routed through the small screen could feel more raw — or more unhinged — than face-to-face encounter.
