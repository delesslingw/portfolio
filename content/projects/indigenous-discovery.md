# Indigenous Corps of Discovery presents: The Smithsonian's Presidential Portrait Gallery
This project took the form of guided walking tours through the Hall of Presidential Portraits at the Smithsonian National Portrait Gallery. Small groups moved from portrait to portrait as the artist provided historical context on each presidency’s relationship to Indigenous peoples, focusing on policies of removal, assimilation, land seizure, and treaty violation. The tour began with Andrew Jackson and proceeded selectively through subsequent administrations, tracing recurring federal strategies toward Native nations.Introduced in the Catawba language and delivered in close proximity to the paintings, the tour combined spoken history, personal lineage, and institutional critique. Participants were encouraged to ask questions as the group moved through the gallery, with each stop anchored to specific legislation, military actions, or federal doctrines associated with the depicted president.The project was unaffiliated with the Smithsonian and operated as an intervention within the museum space, reframing the portraits as active documents of colonial governance rather than neutral national icons.
