Installed in a defunct storefront in Morningside Heights, Snapping Turtle || Wishing Well reconfigured the architecture of commerce into an ecology of myth. A series of panels, painted with clay from our ancestral river, narrated the Catawba story of Rabbit stealing water from Snapping Turtle and encircled a hand-built pond at the center of the space. The artist, costumed in a swim garment, occupied the pond in a state of perpetual saturation: reclining, standing, singing.

An umbrella retrofitted as conduit became both absurd and sacred technology — a pump feeding water upward only to cascade back down, endlessly re-drenching the body beneath. Within this aqueous cycle, the artist layered oral performance: songs of water, the retelling of the Rabbit and Snapping Turtle story, recitations from the International Declaration on the Rights of Water, and songs of honor for the nascent #IdleNoMore movement.

At once elegiac and mischievous, the work sutured Catawba cosmology, hydrological ritual, and juridical text into a single durational score. The storefront became a wishing well, a site of overflow and scarcity, where the soaked body oscillated between oracle, trickster, and drowning witness.
