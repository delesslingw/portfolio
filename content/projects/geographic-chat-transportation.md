# Geographic Chat Transportation

A projection connected the gallery to an online chat roulette platform. On the wall, a live feed of random chat participants appeared at large scale. A webcam aimed at the projected surface captured the audience and sent their image back to the unwitting virtual participant.

At the front of the space, a single button let visitors move to the next connection. Each press brought a new face into the room and sent the gallery’s image back out into the network.

The work examined how strangers met across screens, and how private encounters shifted when made public. Plus it was funny.
